## 🔒 Security & Sanitization Guidelines

<Callout type="error">
  **Critical**: Never commit sensitive data to the public repository!
</Callout>

### ❌ What to NEVER Include

- Real production hostnames (e.g., `mycompany.sapsf.com`)
- Company IDs or tenant identifiers (e.g., `SFSALES123456`)
- Credentials, API keys, or tokens
- Internal employee information (names, IDs, emails)
- Proprietary business data or configurations
- Customer-specific information

### ✅ What is Safe to Include

- Generic documentation URLs (SAP Help Portal, Community)
- Public roadmap links
- SAP Note numbers (publicly available)
- Example configurations with placeholders
- Template code snippets
- Generic test user patterns (`test-employee@test.com`)

### 🛡️ Before Submitting

**Run Security Checks:**

```bash
# Search for credentials
grep -r "password\|credential\|token\|apikey" --include="*.json" resources/

# Check for internal emails
grep -r "@.*\.corp\.sap\|@sap\.com" --include="*.json" resources/

# Look for company IDs
grep -r "SFSALES\|company=" --include="*.json" resources/
```

**Use Placeholders:**
```json
{
  "hostname": "your-company.sapsf.com",
  "notes": "[CUSTOMIZE] Replace with your production hostname"
}
```
